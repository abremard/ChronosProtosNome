# ChronosProtosNome

This is a collaboration project I did with a friend and student in top-level conservatory of Europe.

We both share a passion for music and for understanding the various representations of rhythm and time throughout history and different cultures.

From greeks, indians, western classical, to electronic metronome, human beings have found different approaches to the concept of rhythm, whether through a sound beat, an orchestra conductor's hand movements, through vibrations...

This Flutter app was built as part of that research with the aim of giving a new approach to metronomes for musicians. We wanted to introduce a visual component to modern metronomes as an alternative to the monotone beeping sound of metronomes. 

Unfortunately, this project was discontinued after a few early versions of the app
